CAMT (Cash Management) is a set of bank statement messages defined by ISO 20022, considered the universal financial industry message scheme. There are different standards for different bank statement types. This article focuses specifically on camt.053.

The camt.053 is a detailed bank to customer statement listing all entries booked on the customer’s bank account on a given day. It can be considered an alternative (or replacement) of the less structured MT 940 bank file.

# Camt053Parser Documentation

## Overview

Camt053Parser is a flexible and extensible Python class designed to parse CAMT.053 XML files, which are used for bank-to-customer account report messages in the financial industry. The parser supports multiple versions of the CAMT.053 standard, making it a versatile tool for extracting financial transaction data.

## Installation

To use Camt053Parser, simply copy the Camt053Parser.py file into your project directory, or include it as part of your Python package.

```bash
pip install pycamt
```

## Usage

### Creating an Instance

You can create an instance of the Camt053Parser by providing the XML data as a string:

```python
from Camt053Parser import Camt053Parser

xml_data = "<Document>...</Document>"  # Your CAMT.053 XML data as a string
parser = Camt053Parser(xml_data)
```

Alternatively, you can initialize the parser with a file path:

```python
parser = Camt053Parser.from_file('path/to/your/file.xml')
```

### Extracting Group Header Information

To extract group header information such as message ID and creation date/time:

```python
group_header = parser.get_group_header()
print(group_header)
```

### Extracting Transactions

To retrieve all transaction entries from the file:

```python
transactions = parser.get_transactions()
for transaction in transactions:
    print(transaction)
```

### Extracting Statement Information

To get basic statement information like IBAN and opening/closing balance:

```python
statement_info = parser.get_statement_info()
print(statement_info)
```
